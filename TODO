.LP file parser to generate Python objects representing the problem (aMatrix, rowOrder, colOrder, objective, pName, colRange)

parser is able to parse constraint and objective expressions

need to clean up code and make work on multi-line constraints (i.e. breaking the context-free nature slightly, to get parser to realise the first part is not a second objective)

need to implement the other lp file rules regarding variable bounds, commenting etc
